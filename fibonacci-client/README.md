Instructions on how to build, run the container:
1. docker build -t "image_name" /.
2. docker run -p 8000:8000 "image_name"
(Host Port 8000 mapped to Container Port 8000 when the application is configured to run on)

Instructions on how to deploy to Compute Instance:
Once compute instance (virtual machine) is created, need to use Command Line get virtual machine to
a. install git
b. clone my remote git repository (where the app source code is). 1 instance to client app. 1 instance to server app.
c. install docker
d. build docker image for the specific app
e. run docker image to get the instance (virtual machine) to create a docker container to run the map
f. manage the ingress rules to allow for mapping of the app port settings (in the docker container) to the host port. e.g. allow TCP 80, means allow app access from other computers on container port 80 (where the app is running)
g. Need to ensure public IP address is created for public access








# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
